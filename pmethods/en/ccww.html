<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>What are risks are involved buying bitcoins with credit card?</h3>
<p>First of all, make sure the company you're buying for has a good reputation and is regulated. It's possible that sketchy companies selling bitcoins may be collecting CC information and could possibly scam you later.</p>
<p>Some users have reported cash advanced fees, so be sure to understand how your CC company handles the purchase of bitcoins.</p>

<h3>What are the benefits and advantages?</h3>
<p>It can be easy to get bitcoins fast if purchasing with a debit/credit card. Since most people understand how to shop online using credit and debit cards, it may be easier for less technical buyers to use credit cards to purchase bitcoins. </p>

<h3>What are the disadvantages?</h3>
<p>It's hard to buy large amounts of bitcoins with a CC or DC. Also, the fees are higher due to the risk of fraud and scams.</p>

<h3>Why was purchasing bitcoins with a credit card once difficult?</h3>
<p>Credit card payments are reversible. Actually, merchants don't receive the money from credit card payments until ~60 days after a card is swiped. Because Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, it's risky for a merchant to sell bitcoins for CC payments. Companies have found new ways to prevent fraud and thankfully this has made it much easier to buy with a CC, as evidenced by the many options listed above.</p>
