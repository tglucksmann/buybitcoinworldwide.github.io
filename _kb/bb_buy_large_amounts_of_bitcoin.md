Bitcoin is [becoming attractive as a speculative investment](/kb/investing-in-bitcoin/) as more people begin to [doubt the existing financial system](/kb/category/bitcoin-vs-traditional-finance/) and fiat currencies. Because of this the question “how do I buy large amounts of bitcoin?” is popping up frequently. This post will show you how.

## OTC Exchanges

[Over-the-counter](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) exchanges have helped increase liquidity. Large players now have more options to deal with large blocks of bitcoin, thanks to the companies discussed in depth below. For more information on Bitcoin OTC markets, check out [this explainer from Brave New Coin](http://bravenewcoin.com/news/how-to-buy-large-amounts-of-bitcoin-through-the-otc-market/).  

## Genesis

![genesis trading][1]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

[Genesis](http://genesistrading.com/) is an OTC trading group based in New York. Genesis is a Digital Currency Group company, which is backed by MasterCard and a number of other investment groups.

Genesis has a minimum trade size of 25 BTC, but the average trade is much larger:

> Since September 2013, the Firm has traded over 900,000 Bitcoin (BTC), worth over $360 million United States Dollars, and has completed over 2,400 trades. Genesis makes buying and selling large blocks of digital currency a simple, secure, and supported process. 

This comes out to an average of 375 BTC or $150,000 per trade.  

Genesis isn’t open to everyone. You must [apply and get approved](http://genesistrading.com/contact/) in order to make a trade.

## itBit  

![buy large amounts of bitcoins][2]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

itBit is another New York based exchange, offering both a global exchange and OTC trading.  

[Institutional buyers](https://www.itbit.com/h/exchange#institutions) can buy on itBit’s OTC market, where nearly 40,000 bitcoin per month are exchanged. itBit has shown that it is able to [execute orders very close to spot price](https://www.itbit.com/blog/itbit-bitcoin-otc-market-update-october-2015):  

Like Genesis, itBit isn’t open to everyone. Most of its clients include miners, Bitcoin payment processors, and institutions. Apply [here](https://www.itbit.com/h/exchange#institutions).

## Coinbase

[Coinbase](http://buybitcoinww.co/buycoinbase){:rel="nofollow"} is a good option for individuals who want to buy large quantities of bitcoin. It’s also one of the easiest [ways to buy bitcoin](/kb/how-to-buy-bitcoin/) in the [U.S.](/en/us/), [Canada](/en/ca/), or Europe.

Fully verified users can buy up to $50,000 worth of bitcoin per day on Coinbase, [through a connected bank account via ACH bank transfer](/en/buy-bitcoin-ach-bank-transfer-united-states/), or with a wire transfer.  

[Coinbase](/exchanges/coinbase/) sells Bitcoin at a fixed rate, which is generally very close to market price. The downside to Coinbase is the 1% fee per transaction. If you buy $50,000 worth of bitcoin, you’ll pay a $500 fee and receive $49,500 worth of bitcoin. To prevent paying a fee and to select your own price, see the next option on this list.  

Users in [select states](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/1826671-what-countries-us-states-are-supported-for-coinbase-exchange-) can request to raise their deposit limit from $50,000 to $100,000. If your request is granted, deposits over the $50,000 per day must be made with a wire transfer.  

## Coinbase Exchange  

![coinbase exchange][5]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

[Coinbase Exchange](http://buybitcoinww.co/buycoinbase){:rel="nofollow"} is separate from Coinbase’s brokerage services. Coinbase Exchange is currently the largest U.S. based [Bitcoin exchange](/exchanges/), with around 7,000-10,000 BTC traded daily.  

At Coinbase Exchange [market makers pay no fees](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/1826608-what-are-the-fees-for-using-coinbase-exchange-). If you put in a buy order and someone sells into it, you won’t have to pay a fee. Even as a market taker the fee is only 0.25%.

Coinbase Exchange offers lower limits than what’s offered through Coinbase’s brokerage services: users are limited to $10,000 per day.

Coinbase Exchange is only available in select U.S. states (plus Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico), which currently includes: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin.

## Gemini

![gemini][6]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

The Winklevoss twins launched Gemini in November 2015. Gemini works with both individuals and [institutional clients](https://exchange.gemini.com/register/institution).

Fully verified users have high deposits limits. While the exchange has [received a lot of hype](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/tyler-winklevoss-gemini-will-have-positive-effect-price-bitcoin-1523331), it’s now yet shown in its volume. Due to this users may have a tough time making use of their large deposits. In the future, this may be a better option.  

## Kraken

![kraken][3]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

[Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) is a Bitcoin exchange that trades in Euro. An average day of volume is around 3,000-4,000 bitcoins.  

Kraken is a good option for Europeans, who can deposit via SEPA transfer. Deposit limits vary and depend on your [level of verification](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/201352206-What-are-the-Verification-Tiers-).  

[U.S.](/en/us/) and [U.K.](/en/gb/) users can [deposit via SEPA transfer](/en/buy-bitcoin-sepa-transfer/) or SWIFT. Japanese users can deposit JPY via bank deposit.

## Bitstamp

![bitsamp][4]{: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

[Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/) was one of the first Bitcoin exchanges. It’s based in Slovenia, but backed by a number of U.S. companies, including [Pantera Capital](https://panteracapital.com/about/). Bitstamp’s exchange trades in U.S. dollars, with an average daily volume of 10,000 bitcoins.  

Bitstamp is a good option for European users, who can deposit via SEPA transfer. Bitstamp also accepts SWIFT transfers.

## Xapo

[Xapo](https://xapo.com/) is another place to buy large amounts of bitcoin via SWIFT. Xapo is a trusted company, backed by a number of VC companies including Ribbit capital.  

It’s easy to buy upwards of $50,000 worth of bitcoin with Xapo.
