<h2>Best Bitcoin Hardware Wallet Overviews</h2>			
<p>Hardware wallets are a good choice if you are serious about secure and easy Bitcoin storage. A hardware wallet is a physical Bitcoin wallet that is built with the sole purpose of securing bitcoins. Hardware Bitcoin wallets keep private keys away from internet-connected devices and allow users to sign transactions in an offline environment.</p>

	{% if wallet.tags contains 'hardware' %}
	{% include wallet-list.html %}
	{% endif %}
	{% endfor %}

<h2>What is a Bitcoin Wallet?</h2>
<div id="what"></div>
<p>For someone to store and transact bitcoin, they must own a Bitcoin wallet. Although the analogy of a wallet may seem like a good fit for a digital currency, the reality is that a normal, physical cash wallet is quite different from a Bitcoin wallet. These two objects protect different types of property. In fact, some would argue that a Bitcoin wallet holds no money in it whatsoever.</p>

<h2>Storing Private Keys</h2>

<p>The object that a Bitcoin user needs to secure is not their bitcoin, but <a href="/kb/what-is-a-bitcoin-private-key/">the private keys that unlock their bitcoin</a> on the blockchain. With a Bitcoin wallet, no bitcoin is stored on the local computer or in a bank somewhere. All bitcoin exists on the decentralized ledger, <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain">known as the Bitcoin blockchain</a>.</p>

<p>It may be more correct to refer to a Bitcoin wallet as a bitcoin keychain. It stores all of the private keys associated with your Bitcoin addresses. Instead of worrying about securely storing their bitcoin, users should be concerned with safely storing their private keys. Copies of these keys can also be made, which means the keys can be backed up and stored in multiple locations, much like real, physical keys.</p>

<h2>Types of Bitcoin Wallets</h2>

<p>There are a few <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet">different types of Bitcoin wallets</a> used today, and each of them come with their own tradeoffs between security and convenience:</p>

<p><strong>Software Wallet -</strong> A software wallet is an application that you may download on your desktop, laptop, or smartphone to store your private keys locally. Examples of this type of wallet include Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin XT, <a href="https://electrum.org/">Electrum</a>, Armory, and breadwallet.</p>

<p><strong>Hardware Wallet -</strong> A hardware wallet is a physical hardware device that is built with the sole purpose of securing Bitcoin private keys. The device keeps private keys away from an Internet-connected device and allows users to sign transactions in an offline environment. Examples of bitcoin hardware wallets include <a href="/wallets/trezor/">TREZOR</a> and <a href="/wallets/ledger-nano/">Ledger</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Paper Wallet -</strong> A paper wallet has always been a popular option for <a href="/kb/how-to-store-and-protect-bitcoins/">secure storage of Bitcoin private keys</a>. With this method of storage, private keys are written down or printed on a piece of paper rather than stored on a computer. This type of wallet has become less popular since the development of hardware wallets.</p>

<p><strong>Web Wallet -</strong> A web wallet is a wallet where the private keys are stored in the cloud rather than a local computer. This allows a user to easily have access to their bitcoin on multiple devices. Private keys are generated locally and then encrypted, which means the wallet application provider does not have access to user funds. An example of this type of wallet is <a href="https://blockchain.info/wallet/#/">Blockchain.info</a>.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Banks vs. Wallets</h2>

<p>One last thing to keep in mind when it comes to bitcoin wallets is that there is a difference between a wallet and a bank. Some Bitcoin users view <a href="/wallets/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> and <a href="/wallets/circle/">Circle</a> as Bitcoin wallets, but these Bitcoin companies operate much more like banks. Remember, the private keys are what users need to protect when it comes to using the Bitcoin network. When you hand someone else control over your private keys, you are essentially making a deposit at that financial institution &ndash; much like a deposit at a bank.</p>

<p>This is not to say that bitcoin banks are inherently bad. Coinbase and Circle have done wonders for bringing more users into the ecosystem. It is simply important to remember that whoever controls the private keys controls the bitcoin attached to those keys. A misunderstanding of this point has led to hundreds of millions of US dollars being lost in the past, so it’s important to understand this key difference in how Bitcoin private keys can be stored.</p>

<p>Understanding <a href="/kb/how-does-bitcoin-work/">how bitcoin wallets work</a> is an important aspect of safely using this new technology in its early years of development. Wallets will become much more user friendly over time, and some devices may eventually come with preinstalled wallets that interact with the blockchain without the user’s knowledge in the near future. For now, it’s vital to keep in mind that the private keys are what you need to protect if you want to keep your bitcoin safe from hackers, user error, and other possible issues.</p>
