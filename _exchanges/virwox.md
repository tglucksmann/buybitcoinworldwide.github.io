## Frequently Asked Questions
**Is paying 9% to [VirWoX](http://buybitcoinww.co/bitcoin_virwox){:rel="nofollow"} really the best way to buy bitcoin with PayPal?**

Unfortunately, it's the best way and also the cheapest. If you try to buy bitcoin with PayPal directly from someone using LocalBitcoins, you'll still end up paying a 10% markup due to the risk of fraud.
