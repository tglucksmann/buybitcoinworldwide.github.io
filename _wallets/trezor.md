[TREZOR](http://buybitcoinww.co/TREZOR_Wallet){:rel="nofollow"} launched in [August 2014](http://satoshilabs.com/news/2014-08-07-trezor-sales-launched-buytrezor-com/) as the first Bitcoin hardware wallet, offering secure cold storage plus the ability to spend with the convenience of a hot wallet. [TREZOR](http://buybitcoinww.co/TREZOR_Wallet){:rel="nofollow"} is a small, key-sized device which connects to your computer with a USB cable. It stores your Bitcoin private keys offline and signs transactions. It can be safely used on a malware infected computer. 

TREZOR is compatible with a number of wallets, including [Electrum](/wallets/electrum/), MultiBit HD, and [GreenAddress](/wallets/greenaddress/) on desktop, [GreenBits](/wallets/greenbits/) and [Mycelium](/wallets/mycelium/) on Android, and [myTREZOR.com](https://mytrezor.com) on the web. Use the TREZOR Chrome extension to manage your device. 

TREZOR can also be used as a secure login device on a [number of websites](http://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-apps/index.html).

##Security
{: .security .wallet-sections}
[TREZOR](http://buybitcoinww.co/TREZOR_Wallet){:rel="nofollow"} provides top-notch security for bitcoin, protecting against both physical and virtual theft. 

TREZOR is an HD wallet where you control the private keys, so an entire wallet can be backed up with the 24 words generated on setup. The original 24-word seed is generated using RNG from the device and the computer. The seed is generated offline and displayed on the TREZOR's screen, which ensures that the seed is never on an internet-connected device. 

A PIN code is required on setup, and required for spending. After each incorrect guess the wait between guesses is raised by a power of two. Making 30 guesses would take 17 years. 

You can add a passphrase to the 24-word seed for extra security, which acts as a 25th word. You must remember the passphrase because the seed without the passphrase is not enough to recover the wallet. A passphrase offers more security, but if forgotten the wallet cannot be recovered. 

You can recover the entire wallet with the 24-word seed and passphrase if used, in the event that your TREZOR is lost or damaged. Recovery can be done with another TREZOR or with other wallets, like [Electrum](/kb/restore-trezor-seed-electrum/) or [Mycelium](/kb/restore-trezor-seed-mycelium-android/). 

TREZOR's screen allows you to confirm that you're sending to the intended recipient, but this does not prevent against phishing attacks. 

A full overview of how TREZOR handles security threats can [be found on the Satoshi Labs website](http://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-faq/threats.html).

##Privacy
{: .privacy .wallet-sections}
TREZOR itself offers very good privacy. Satoshi Labs has no way of tracking your actions after you receive the device because it has no serial number. All of the software is open source. No usernames or passwords are needed when using [TREZOR](http://buybitcoinww.co/TREZOR_Wallet){:rel="nofollow"}.

Privacy is determined by the wallet used with TREZOR: [Electrum](/wallets/electrum/), MultiBit HD, and [GreenAddress](/wallets/greenaddress/) on desktop, [GreenBits](/wallets/greenbits/) and [Mycelium](/wallets/mycelium/) on Android, and myTREZOR.com on the web.
