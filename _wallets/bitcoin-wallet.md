##Security
{: .security .wallet-sections}
A mobile wallet is only as secure as the device it’s running on. An unrooted Android device should be used.

A file containing the wallet’s private keys are encrypted and stored on your phone. The file should be backed up to another location in case your phone is lost or reset.

Bitcoin Wallet is more secure than most mobile Bitcoin wallets, because it connects directly to the Bitcoin network with SPV. Most other wallets connect to centralized servers for transaction information.

##Privacy
{: .privacy .wallet-sections}
Bitcoin Wallet is an HD wallet. It generates a new address for each transaction making it more difficult for spying or tracking your payments.

Because the wallet connects directly to the Bitcoin network peers can see your phone’s IP address.

Bitcoin wallet received a score of 46 out of 100 from the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project’s [Spring 2015 report](http://openbitcoinprivacyproject.org/2015/05/spring-2015-wallet-privacy-rating-report/).
