## Price 

Costs $239 and can be [purchased on Amazon](http://buybitcoinww.co/KeepKey_Amazon){:rel="nofollow"}. High price tag is due to its digital screen, metal body, and high level of security.

## Security

The purpose of a hardware wallet is to store private keys offline in a secure envoriment. KeepKey provides top-notch security and protects against both physical & virtual theft. It can be used on any computer, even one that's been infected with malware or targeted by hackers. Think of it as a tiny computer that's built specifically to store Bitcoin private keys. 

In addition to offline storage, KeepKey's pin code and number randomization makes sure that 1) your wallet is secure from physical theft and 2) that a hacker couldn't steal bitcoins from your wallet with malware. Watch the video below for an example of the pin protection:

[KeepKey](http://buybitcoinww.co/KeepKey_Amazon){:rel="nofollow"} is an HD wallet, meaning your entire wallet can be backed up with the 12 words generated on setup. 12 words is the default setting, although KeepKey supports seed lengths of 18 and 24. 

The seed is generated using entropy from both the device itself and the computer used for setup. The seed is generated offline on the KeepKey and displayed on the device's screen. The device's offline screen makes sure the seed is never displayed on an internet-connected device.

You can recover your wallet using the backup seed if your device is lost, stolen, or damaged. Recovery can be done with [KK's Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keepkey-wallet/hmldnhmidmcofnbojkgfnibmhmjopbpc). Make sure to keep multiple backups of your seed and follow other best practices. 

The wallet's screen helps confirm you’re sending to the intended recipient, but does not prevent phishing attacks.  

## Setup and Initialization

Watch the video above or read our in-depth guide to learn how to initialize a KeepKey. The process is very simple and only takes a few minutes.

## Privacy

As with any hardware wallet, using your device is only as private as the software wallet it's used with. [Electrum](/wallets/electrum/), KeepKey Chrome, and MultiBit HD support KeepKey. Electrum is the most private of the three.

## KeepKey vs. Ledger Wallet Nano

The main difference between the [Ledger Nano](/wallets/ledger-nano/) and KK is that KeepKey has a screen, while the Ledger Nano does not.

## KeepKey vs. TREZOR

KeepKey is actually a port of the TREZOR's code and firmware. The main difference between KK and [TREZOR](/wallets/trezor/) is that KK offers a digital screen and the ability to recover the seed even on an unsafe or malware infected computer. 

## KeepKey vs. Paper Wallet

KeepKey may be better than a paper wallet for less technical users. Paper wallets can be hard to setup and it's easy to make mistakes. With KK it's easier to create secure offline storage. Paper wallets are just as secure if created correctly, though. 

## KeepKey Promo Code

There are currently no KeepKey promo codes available. If a coupon or discount code becomes available we'll update this post. 

## Does KeepKey Work with Litecoin?

KeepKey can be used to store Litecoin, DASH, and other altcoins. It's up to software wallet developers to integrate support--the device itself is compatible with any altcoin.
